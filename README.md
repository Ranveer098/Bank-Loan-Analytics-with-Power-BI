## Introduction 
Bank Loan Analytics with Power BI is our initiative to enhance loan management. We use data techniques to improve lending operations. Through SQL queries and Power BI, we analyze cleaned data to extract key performance indicators (KPIs). This helps us make informed decisions, manage risks, and strengthen our loan portfolio.


## Problem Statement for Dashboard 1: Summary:

1.Effective management of loan operations requires keen oversight of key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess performance and guide decision-making. The dashboard aims to address the following KPI requirements:

Total Loan Applications: Track the total number of loan applications over time, including Month-to-Date (MTD) figures and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

Total Funded Amount: Monitor the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, along with MTD and MoM variations.

Total Amount Received: Evaluate the total amount received from borrowers to manage cash flow and loan repayment, including MTD and MoM analysis.

Average Interest Rate: Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and observe MoM fluctuations to understand the cost of lending.

Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Assess the financial health of borrowers by computing the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and tracking MoM fluctuations.



**Problem Statement for Dashboard 1: Summary: Good Loan v Bad Loan KPI’s:**

To ensure a balanced portfolio and minimize risk, it's crucial to differentiate between good and bad loans. The dashboard aims to provide insights into:

- **Good Loan KPIs:** Including percentages, counts, and amounts for good loan applications and disbursements.
  
- **Bad Loan KPIs:** Including percentages, counts, and amounts for bad loan applications and disbursements.

**Problem Statement for Dashboard 1: Summary: Loan Status Grid View:**

A comprehensive grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status' is essential for a holistic overview of lending operations. The grid view will include metrics such as total loan applications, funded amount, amount received, MTD figures, average interest rate, and average DTI. This will facilitate data-driven decision-making and portfolio assessment.

**Problem Statement for Dashboard 2: Overview:**

Dashboard 2 aims to provide an overview of lending activities through various charts:

1. **Monthly Trends:** Identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities using a line chart.
  
2. **Regional Analysis:** Assess regional disparities and identify regions with significant lending activity via a filled map.
  
3. **Loan Term Analysis:** Understand loan distribution across different term lengths using a donut chart.
  
4. **Employee Length Analysis:** Evaluate the impact of employment history on loan applications through a bar chart.
  
5. **Loan Purpose Breakdown:** Provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on stated loan purposes using a bar chart.
  
6. **Home Ownership Analysis:** Examine how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements via a tree map.

Metrics to be displayed include total loan applications, funded amount, and amount received.

**Problem Statement for Dashboard 3: Details:**

The Details Dashboard aims to provide a consolidated view of essential loan-related metrics and data points. Its objective is to offer a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data, including borrower profiles and loan performance metrics. This dashboard will serve as a central hub for detailed insights into the loan portfolio.
